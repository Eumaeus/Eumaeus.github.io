With [Neel Smith](http://neelsmith.github.io), I work on the [CITE Architecture](http://cite-architecture.github.io) for analysis of texts, images, and other data in a digital environment. Beginning in May of 2016 I will be taking a full-time sabbatical from my teaching at [Furman University](http://www.furman.edu) to pursue citation-based approaches to textual analysis. I will try to document the progress of that work here.
