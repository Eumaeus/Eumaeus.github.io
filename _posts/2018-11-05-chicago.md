# A Newer LSJ

Last week we published [a Markdown version of the LSJ lexicon](https://eumaeus.github.io/2018/10/30/lsj.html). On Monday, Professor Helma Dik of the [various digital Classics initiatives at the University of Chicago](http://perseus.uchicago.edu) send me XML editions of the LSJ that her team has been lovingly curating for the past decade. 

This version fixes errors in many lemmata and the structure of entries, and improves Unicode presentation of the Greek.

As of today (Tuesday, November 6, 2018), the [CITE Architecture LSJ Browsing application](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/) defaults to this new collection of LSJ entries.

## Versions of Collections

The CITE Architecture is based on *machine-actionable canonical citation* of objects that scholars study. *Canonical* citations can't change; a CITE2 URN must always identify the *same thing*.

For this lexicon project, we identified a *notional* collection of "LSJ Entries", which we can cite with this URN:

> `urn:cite2:hmt:lsj:`

To see *actual data*, however, we need a "version-level" URN. Before November 6, 2018, the LSJ application was querying a service for objects in the versioned-collection identified by: `urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.markdown:`.

With the creation of a new version of a collection of LSJ entries, based on the Chicago data, we are querying for objects in the collection `urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:`.

The structure of the CITE2 URN preserved the "scholarly identity" of these two collections. They are both collections of LSJ entries, and two URNs with the same object-identifier should point to the "same" (notional) entity in both versions, albeit with different data:

## Canonically Citable Data in a Changing World

On November 4, 2018, Dr. Monica Berti [announced that she had incorporated the LSJ browser into the Digital Athenaeus](https://goo.gl/CQdHVk). Clearly, any URNs that Dr. Berti has included in her data will no longer work with the updated application. I did not want to break Dr. Berti's work (especially since I was super flattered that she liked this web-application). I did not want to have to let the LSJ Browser support multiple versions of the LSJ (I have other things I need to do in life). I definitely wanted to default to the Chicago version. As tempting as it was just to replace the LSJ collection with new data, keeping the `markdown`-versioned URNs, that wouldn't be correct. Here's what I'm doing:

- Both versions of the LSJ data are on the [Github repository](https://github.com/Eumaeus/cite_lsj_cex) as [CEX files](https://cite-architecture.github.io/citedx/CEX-spec-3.0.1/). The Chicago data is added to the [`lexica.cex` that includes LSJ and the Lewis & Short Latin dictionary in a single CEX file](https://github.com/Eumaeus/fuCiteDX). 
- The [Scala CITE Services](https://eumaeus.github.io/2018/11/04/lexService.html) service will include both versions of the LSJ data, so anyone can query them both, by URN.
- The [LSJ Browser](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/) application will exert its privileges as an application—to do whatever it feels like—and accept *any* version of the notional `urn:cite2:hmt:lsj:` collection, but will deliver data only from whatever version is configured as the current supported one, for now, `chicago_md`. So if you query `urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.markdown:n29873` you will see results from `urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n29873` (and you will see from the URN that you got a different version).
- This is super easy thanks to the [xcite Scala library](https://github.com/cite-architecture/xcite), which offers many well-tested methods for manipulating CITE2 and CTS URNs.
