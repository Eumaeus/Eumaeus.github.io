## The Lewis & Short Dictionary

> *A Latin Dictionary.* Founded on Andrewsâ€™ edition of Freund's Latin dictionary, revised, enlarged, and in great part rewritten by Charlton T. Lewis, Ph.D., and Charles Short, LL.D. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1879)

Thanks to [The Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0059) and [The National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov), we have this 19th Century Latin dictionary in a machine-readable format.
